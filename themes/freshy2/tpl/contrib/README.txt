Hi,

In this directory, you will find template files customized for the following plugins :
- blogRollPage : file blogroll.html
- categoriesMode : file categories.html
- contactMe : file contact_me.html
- contact : file contact.idblog.html where idblog is to be replaced with your blog ID
- subscribetocomments : file subscribetocomments.html

If you use these plugins, simply move the corresponding html file to the tpl/ theme folder, to have them 
suit correctly with the freshy2 specific theme structure.

The gallery plygin theme files are directly in their directories
- gallery (version 0.2.16) : files galleries.html, gallery.html and image.html in default/ directory
- gallery (version 0.3.1) : files galleries.html, gallery.html and image.html in gal_default/ directory


If you have a specific request for a plugin that doesn't fit correctly with the Freshy2 theme, please contact
contact@brol.info and we'll try to see how to fix it.

Thanks;-)
