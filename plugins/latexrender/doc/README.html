  <title>Plugin latexrender for Dotclear 2</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The LaTeXrender plugin is an extension that allows a server for
Dotclear 2 and an installation of [tex]\LaTeX[/tex] (a word procesor,
very much used for its mathematical typesetting capabilities and the
reference format for scientific publication in many areas) to display
(as embedded pictures) bits of text composed by [tex]\LaTeX[tex]. It is
bound with a settings interface to allow for unusual paths for the
auxiliary programs.</p>
<p>This plugin is on one hand, the conversion of an already existing
class (the <a href="http://www.mayer.dial.pipex.com/tex.htm"
hreflang="en">latexrender class</a>, written in PHP for a few
interfaces; on the other hand, the class was simplified, adapted to the
restricted framework of Dotclear 2, and enhanced for the vertical offset
computation (after a patch by Mike Boyle modified again by me) and
enhanced again by adding a colour management (some people design web
sites and themes written yellow or white on a dark background, and the
former class only produced black text, which was pretty unreadable).</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Use the zipped file attached to this post.Go then to the
administration area as <strong>super-admin</strong>, and fill in the various access paths
to the auxiliary programs (the default values should be fine on most
servers ; [tex]\LaTeX[/tex] and the <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php" hreflang="en">ImageMagick</a> set of programs are used) as well as
a few other parameters. Their meaning should be self-evident; if this is
not the case, please submit a bug report.</p>

<p>The extension requires an installation on the server of latex and the
ImageMagick set of programs (mostly the <code>convert</code>
and <code>identify</code> utilities). Most providers do not install
those utilities (<code>latex</code> especially, ImageMagick may be more
frequent), but on specific hosting platforms (self-hosted,
enterprise-level servers, lab or university web servers) this is usually
very simple to install, these are very classical software packages under
Linux.</p>
<p>This extension requires the <a href="/post/stacker">stacker
extension</a> to be installed. A solution that does not require this
extension is in the works, but without that it will be necessary to
conflict with other extensions that do redefine the access to the posts'
contents (note: as the author uses several of them, this is therefore
considered as a bug).</p>
<p class="version">The current version of this plugin is 0.8 (local svn  303).</p><p class="licence">This plugin is licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en" hreflang="en">CC-BY</a>.</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<h4>Basic usage</h4>
<p>The basic usage is really easy, it is sufficient to type the [tex]\LaTeX[/tex] code
in between two pseudo-markup <code>[tex]...[/tex]</code>. For example,
[tex]$\displaystyle\int_{0}^{1}\frac{x^{4}\left(1-x\right)^{4}}{1+x^{2}}dx
=\frac{22}{7}-\pi$[/tex].</p>
<p>The equations are represented as images and the LaTeX code is used as
the title for the image.</p>

<p>The limitations on what can be typeset with [tex]\LaTeX[/tex] are a
restriction of allowed instructions (no <code>\special</code>, for
example), the code pieces must be composed in horizontal mode (if one
wants to compose in vertical mode, for big equations for example or many
paragraphs, one has to put a minipage environment around the typeset
part:
<code>\begin{minipage}{500px}...\end{minipage}</code>). This is a restriction coming
from [tex]\LaTeX[/tex], not from the extension.</p>
<p>The pictures are stored in the blogs' public directory, by default in a
subdirectory called <code>latexrender/images</code>.</p>
<h4>Colour management</h4>
<p>The original class could not manage colours: the text was always
rendered black (on a transparent background in the last versions). Some
themes feature a dark background, making the plugin unusable in such
circumstances. It is possible to inform LaTeXrender about the main color
wanted for the rendered text in the page. For example, on this page, the
original theme <em>Grey Silence</em> does no specific post-treatement,
but the theme <em>LIPN-hiver</em> was white on black.</p>
<p>If you choose the <em>colorization method</em>, and you have a recent enough
version of Imagemagick (it works at least with ImageMagick 6.2.4 02/10/07
Q16), you will be able to use this possibility; it is
sufficient to add in one of your theme
files (just before the last line, which should read ?&gt;), the
expression <code>$core-&gt;theme_color='FFFFFF';</code>. This line can
be added before the last line of either <code>_public.php</code>
or <code>_prepend.php</code>. If neither of these files are present, a
file <code>_public.php</code> consisting of one line can be added:</p>
<pre class="code">&lt;?php $core-&gt;theme_color='FFFFFF'; ?&gt;</pre>
<p>FFFFFF is to be replaced by the desired colour, coded in hexadecimal (here, white; yellow is FFFF00, red is FF0000).</p>
<div class="bug"><h3>To tell me about a bug or helping this plugin</h3><p>The best way is to contact me <a href="http://jean-christophe.dubacq.fr/pages/Contact">by mail</a> (for a bug) or leave a comment (telling me you tested this extension) at the maintenance page. In case of an update, I will modify the maintenance page accordingly.</p></div><div class="changelog"><p>Note: this changelog is not complete, automatically generated and probably not even informative before 2009.</p><ul><li>Local SVN release 303 (jcdubacq,2009-01-27)<ul> <li>Fix locales</li> </ul></li> <li>Local SVN release 297 (jcdubacq,2009-01-26)<ul> <li>Adapt to version 0.3 of stacker (behavior initStacker)</li> </ul></li> <li>Local SVN release 292 (jcdubacq,2009-01-22)<ul> <li>Update documentation, release new version 0.6</li> </ul></li> <li>Local SVN release 259 (jcdubacq,2008-11-18)<ul> <li>Fix public url usage in admin area</li> </ul></li> <li>Local SVN release 205 (jcdubacq,2008-07-24)<ul> <li>Add documentation, new version</li> </ul></li> <li>Local SVN release 187 (jcdubacq,2008-07-09)<ul> <li>Add admin page, rewrite latexrender class to better fit the needs of DC2</li> </ul></li> <li>Local SVN release 168 (jcdubacq,2008-05-06)<ul> <li>Order plugins and themes</li> </ul></li> <li>Local SVN release 47 (jcdubacq,2008-02-15)<ul> <li>Add latexrender plugin</li> </ul></li></ul></div>
<h3>To do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make a version of this plugin that does not depend
on <code>stacker</code> plugin</li>
<li>Communicate with the initial authors of <code>class.latexrender.php</code></li>
<li>Manage colours independently of the themes</li>
<li>Work with Sacha to make a client/server version of latexrender that
could convey both image and vertical offset, with enough security (the
image computation may have a CPU cost too high and too risky if anybody
could call the server)</li>
