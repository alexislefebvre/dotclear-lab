ApcCache plugin installation

CONFIGURATION
-------------

You may add the following constants in your main config.php file:

DC_APC_CACHE_ENABLE 	: set to false to disable caching system (default true)
DC_APC_CACHE_SCHEDULED	: ensure posts scheduling compatibiliy


HINTS
-----

If you want cache to be called before *any* connection to database, add a
require statement to _post_config.php at the end of your configuration file.


NOTES
-----

This plugin is in early stage, and is nothing more than an idiot port of MemCache plugin.
You should note consider it safe for production environments without further tests.
