  <title>Plugin kezako for Dotclear 2</title>
</head>
<body>
The Kezako plugin (french word meaning "what is that?") is a plugin that
was designed to fill two specific gaps in Dotclear 2 interface:
<ul><li>One could not describe tags. When a selection of articles is
done based on a keyword, such as <a href="/tag/debian">debian</a>
or <a href="/tag/photo">photo</a>, one had only the keyword written at
the top with no further explanations.</li>
<li>One could describe a category, but only in one language. Adding a
language management could be done through some complicated work (which I
did).</li>
</ul>
<p>I implemented such a system, allowing to attach a description in one
or more languages to a specific tag or category (thus replacing the
existing system for categories). It can in fact be attached at anything
(but nothing was done to exploit it in a context other than a tag or a
category). This is the Kezako plugin.</p>
<hr class="separator" />
<p>This system is flexible enough so that if nothing is specifically
defined for some tag or category, the old system is used instead
(displaying the tag or the category's description). There is no
mandatory description for each and every tag.</p>
<p>This extension for Dotclear 2 requires the modification of one page
of the theme used for the blog (it is now very easy with the theme
editor included with Dotclear 2). It is necessary in
the <code>tag.html</code> page, where the description of the tag should
be, to surround the current presentation of the tag
by <code>&lt;tpl:TagDescription&gt;...&lt;/tpl:TagDescription&gt;</code>.
For example:
</p>
<pre>&lt;tpl:TagDescription&gt;&lt;h2&gt;{{tpl:lang Keyword}} - {{tpl:MetaID}}&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/tpl:TagDescription&gt;</pre>
<p>This extension adds a table in the database. It was not tested with
PostgresQL (but I do not see why it should not work, I use only very
simple operations).</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Use the zipped file attached to this post. Go then to the
administration area, and give the editor permission to the users allowed
to attach descriptions to tags or categories. The Kezako menu should
appear in the administration interface for these users. Do also the
theme modification mentioned above. If the table was not created, you
probably did not go to the administration area.</p>

<p>There are two settings for this plugin: one that allows to override the
category description, and one that allows to use descriptions in several
languages (and not only in the blog's language). Since most blogs are
monolingual and that in this case, the category override is not useful,
both of these settings are disabled by default. For a full usage of this
plugin, they can be enabled. Remark that the language of your blog must
be set if you use only the blog's language.</p>
<p>I did not find any matching plugin elsewhere.</p>
<p class="version">The current version of this plugin is 0.7 (local svn  380).</p><p class="licence">This plugin is licensed under <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html" hreflang="en">GPL version 2.0</a>.</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<div class="photo"><a href="/public/photos/dotclear/kezako-list.png"><img src="/public/photos/dotclear/.kezako-list_m.jpg" alt="Liste des descriptions" title="List of descriptions" /></a><div class="legende">List of descriptions</div></div>
<p>In the "Blog" section of the administration area, you access the two
parameters and the list of all known descriptions. You can modify or
delete descriptions, or insert a new one. When you insert or modify a
description, you use the usual visual editor of Dotclear. The identifier
of the description for a tag is the tag itself, the language is to be
chosen from the menu (if you chose to use the many languages
option). Your description is completely up to you. Remark that for tags,
it will replace the former display (Keyword - tag), not be appended to
it.</p>
<div class="photo"><a href="/public/photos/dotclear/kezako-entry.png"><img src="/public/photos/dotclear/.kezako-entry_m.jpg" alt="Entrée d'une description" title="Entrée d'une description" /></a><div class="legende">Entrée d'une description</div></div>
<p>If a description for a category is not found by Kezako in its own tables,
the description internal to Dotclear is used instead. Thus, Kezako has no
visible effect on a blog where the plugin is installed but unused.</p>
<div class="bug"><h3>To tell me about a bug or helping this plugin</h3><p>The best way is to contact me <a href="http://jean-christophe.dubacq.fr/pages/Contact">by mail</a> (for a bug) or leave a comment (telling me you tested this extension) at the maintenance page. In case of an update, I will modify the maintenance page accordingly.</p></div><div class="changelog"><p>Note: this changelog is not complete, automatically generated and probably not even informative before 2009.</p><ul><li>Local SVN release 380 (jcdubacq,2009-05-10)<ul> <li>Reduce db fields sizes, hoping to fix <a href="http://lab.dotclear.org/ticket/170">#170</a></li> </ul></li> <li>Local SVN release 366 (jcdubacq,2009-04-30)<ul> <li>Fix licence blocks</li> <li>Clean up code</li> <li>New design for administration interface</li> </ul></li> <li>Local SVN release 270 (jcdubacq,2008-12-22)<ul> <li>Add common filtering attributes</li> </ul></li> <li>Local SVN release 251 (jcdubacq,2008-11-13)<ul> <li>Use categories descriptions by default, fix doc</li> </ul></li> <li>Local SVN release 196 (jcdubacq,2008-07-19)<ul> <li>Reindent kezako plugin, clean, fix, and generally make better.
