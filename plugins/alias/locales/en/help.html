<p>Aliases allow you to map any URLs you create to any available resource of
your blog.</p>

<dl>
     <dt>Alias URL</dt>
     <dd>Alias URL is the URL you create, without your blog URL. An alias URL
     named "aboutme" will be caught when someone call http://yourblog/aboutme
     page.</dd>
     
     <dt>Alias destination</dt>
     <dd>Alias destination is the resource your alias is pointing to. If you
     create an alias called "aboutme" and want it to serve your static page
     "aboutme", alias destination will be "pages/aboutme".</dd>
     
     <dt>Regular expressions</dt>
     <dd>You can use regular expression by wrapping alias URL with "/";
     ie. "/^word\/(.+)?$/". You can use captures in destination; ie.
     "tag/$1".</dd>
