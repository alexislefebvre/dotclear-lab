Static Cache plugin installation

CONFIGURATION
-------------

You may add the following constants in your main config.php file:

DC_SC_CACHE_ENABLE : set to false to disable caching system (default false)
DC_SC_CACHE_DIR    : full path to cache directory (default to dcstaticcache in your cache directory)


HINTS
-----

If you want cache to be called before *any* connection to database, add a
require statement to _post_config.php at the end of your configuration file.
