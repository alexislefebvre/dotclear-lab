<p>This plugin lets visitors export a blog page or the home page as an <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opendocument">OpenDocument</a> (ODT)
file.</p>

<p>This page lets you control various aspects of the plugin. To display the ODT
export link, a presentation widget is also available.</p>

<dl>
     <dt>Export button</dt>
     <dd>This field sets where the export button should be placed on the post
     page.</dd>
     
     <dt>Import remote images</dt>
     <dd>During the ODT generation, Dotclear can download the remote images
     linked in your blog post. The advantage is that the image will be bundled
     inside the ODT document, making it faster to load and more "independant".
     The downside is that the ODT generation can be longer, or even fail if
     your blog's server is not allowed to download from the Internet.</dd>
     
     <dt>Configuration error</dt>
     <dd>If you get an error message about a <em>configuration error</em>, it
     means your PHP installation is missing the XSLT module. If your blog is
     hosted on a Linux distribution, the required module is likely to be in a
     package named "php-xsl".</dd>
