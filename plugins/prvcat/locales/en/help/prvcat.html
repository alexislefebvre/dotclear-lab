<h3>Description</h3>

<p><acronym title="PRiVate CATegories">prvcat</acronym> let you set one or more
categories as private. When you set a category as private, the password you
defined is attributed to all posts of this category. You can then access those posts
by using direct link, and entering correct password. You can also access from
with category page, after entering correct password.</p>

<h3>Difference between prvcat and dotclear management of private posts.</h3>
<p>prvcat allows global management of private posts: an unique password for all
posts. Access to private posts is also more easy: user just needs to browse
category page. The disadvantage of this method is the possibility for normal
users to notice that you have some private posts. If you do not want all
your users to known you have some private posts, do not use this plugin.</p>

<p>When a category is not managed by prvcat, private posts works the standard
way. Then, you can have one or more private categories, and still have
"standard" private posts in some other categories.</p>
