TSearch for Dotclear
====================

--------------------------------------------------
/!\ THIS PLUGIN DOES ONLY WORK WITH POSTGRESQL /!\
--------------------------------------------------

INSTALL
=======

Note: "dotclearDB" is your Dotclear database name.

First, install tsearch2 for your postgresql installation. On debian, you should
find it in postgresql-contrib package.

As PostgreSQL super user, connect to your Dotclear database and launch
tsearch2.sql file:

postgres$ psql dotclearDB < tsearch2.sql

Once tsearch schema is created on your database, you'll need some functions
in public schema.

First, add pl/pgsql language on your database (as postgres user):

postgres$ createlang plpgsql dotclearDB

Then, launch schema.sql file. Note that you need to adapt tables prefix if you
changed it in your Dotclear installation:

PLEASE READ THIS FILE FIRST!

$ psql -U dotclearuser dotclearDB < schema.sql


ENABLE TSEARCH IN YOUR CONFIGURATION FILE
=========================================

To enable tsearch, you need to add the following line in your config.php
file:

define('DC_TSEARCH_ACTIVE',true);
